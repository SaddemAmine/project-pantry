# Project Name Specification

## 1. Overview
I’ve been struggling to keep track of what’s in my pantry, which inspired me to build a kitchen management app. The goal is to make it easier for people like me to stay organized and reduce food waste. What's very motivating and exciting is how there’s a lot of potential for growth within this idea.

This app could evolve to include features like smart inventory tracking, meal planning, shopping list integration, and even expiration date reminders.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
- Manage inventory.
    - Track what's in the pantry, expiration dates and quantities.
- Meal planning.
- Suggest recipes based on available ingredients.
- Suggest recipes based on dietary preferences.
- Smart shopping list integration.
    - Could include product reviews and recommendations based on other users' experiences.

### Non-Goals
- No super fancy AI stuff for now. I want to focus on the features and refine them before including that.
